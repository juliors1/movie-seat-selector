# movie-seat-selector
  Select movie choices and seats in a theater to purchase tickets. I used HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript.

Specifications:
- Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info
- Number of seats and price will update
- Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh
